They both agree that ignition happens, i.e that it's a key empirical phenomenon that needs explaining.
The difference is whether it is assumed to be constitutive of consciousness, or a by-product of computations
related to consciousness. GWS says that it's constitutive - global broadcast underpins conscious access,
and ignition is the neural signature of broadcast. HOSS says that ignition is a by-product of computations
related to consciousness. Under HOSS, consciousness is tied to the higher-order evaluation of the
reliability/strength of first-order state(s) - and when a first-order state is reliable / precise,
it will also be associated with widespread updates to the internal model which manifest as ignition.
