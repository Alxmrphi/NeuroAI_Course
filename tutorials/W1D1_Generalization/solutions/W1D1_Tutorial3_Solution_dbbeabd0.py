Inferring how humans perform cognitive tasks is a central question in cognitive science.
Our ability to infer our strategies by introspection is limited, but controlled lab
experiments can help us tease apart how we perform tasks.

Lake et al. (2015) ask:

> How do people learn new concepts from just one or a few examples? And how do
people learn such abstract, rich, and flexible representations? An even greater challenge arises
when putting them together: How can learning succeed from such sparse data yet also produce
such rich representations?

In the next section, we'll explore one model that can reach human-level performance
through strong inductive biases, involving:

* bottom-up visual processing
* a generative model
* a neurosymbolic approach
