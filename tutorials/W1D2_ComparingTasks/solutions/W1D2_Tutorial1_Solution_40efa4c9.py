- Inpainting, similar to autoencoding, necessitates a substantial amount of data for effective training.
A large dataset ensures the model can learn to fill in missing parts of images accurately by recognizing
a wide variety of patterns and contexts.

- There are some successful examples of inpainting when using a dataset of 10,000 points. However,
the network has not fully converged yet, similar to what is observed in the autoencoder scenario.
This indicates that while the model shows promise, it requires further training or additional data
to achieve optimal performance.
