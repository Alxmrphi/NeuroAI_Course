"""
We see that the representations learned by the regression model transfered the worst,
while the autoencoder and inpainting tasks transferred almost on par.

Interestingly, the regression model performed best *on its task*, which was very simple,
but transfered the worst. Unsupervised tasks based on finding good representations of the
data or finding regularities in the data can be useful for transfer learning.
