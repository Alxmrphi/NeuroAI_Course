"""
- The model requires more data to train effectively. With a limited dataset, the model lacks
the necessary information to learn the underlying patterns and generalize well to new data.

- Even with a dataset of 10,000 training points, the model is still not training sufficiently.
This suggests that the current training strategy or model architecture might need adjustment
to fully utilize the available data and improve performance.

- When using a dataset of only 1000 training points, the model achieves better accuracy by simply
guessing which parts of the image are likely to have pixels ON on average. This leads to training
stagnation because the model is not learning meaningful patterns, but rather exploiting the
statistical properties of the limited data.
