"""
As expected, the representations learned during the regression task are not useful
for reconstruction. Since the encoder weights of the autoencoder are frozen, the model
cannot adapt and learn an effective decompression of the original images. This limitation
prevents the autoencoder from improving its reconstruction capabilities based on the new
task, leading to suboptimal performance in image reconstruction.
