Our brain's ability to perform contrastive learning is linked to the function of the ventral visual stream.
This area of the brain processes visual information and has been shown to develop hierarchical features that
capture the structure of visual input through self-supervised learning mechanisms. Evidence suggests that anterior
regions of the ventral visual stream, particularly the anterior occipito-temporal cortex (aOTC), encode substantial
information about object categories without requiring explicit category-level supervision (Konkle and Alvarez, 2022).
Instead, these representations emerge through domain-general learning from natural image structures, where the brain
differentiates between individual views and categories based on the inherent statistical properties of visual input
(Livingstone et al., 2019; Arcaro and Livingstone, 2021). This capability supports the notion that the brain's visual
system can form complex object representations and categorization using self-supervised learning frameworks similar to
those in artificial neural networks.
