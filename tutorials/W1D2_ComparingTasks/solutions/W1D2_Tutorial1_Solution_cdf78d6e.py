"""
Small sample sizes: With small sample sizes, the model cannot improve significantly and remains inaccurate.
The limited data does not provide enough variability or information for the model to learn effectively.

Medium sample sizes (1000 Points): With a medium sample size of 1000 points, there is noticeable improvement
in the model's performance. However, the progress is slow, and it is unlikely that the model will achieve very
high accuracy due to the limited diversity and quantity of data.

High sample sizes (10,000 Points): With a high sample size, the model can achieve good performance within a
few epochs. Here, an epoch involves the model seeing 10,000 points, which significantly accelerates learning
and leads to more accurate results due to the greater amount of data and variability provided.
