Note that even though the weights of the encoder part of the network are not allowed to change,
the network still manages to become a good autoencoder, successfully reconstructing the original
images. This indicates that the classification task leads to representations that are generalizable.
However, it is important to note that, similar to previous observations, the network has not fully
converged even after 10 iterations.
