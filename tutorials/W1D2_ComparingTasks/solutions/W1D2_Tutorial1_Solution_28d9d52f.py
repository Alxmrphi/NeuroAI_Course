"""
At small sample sizes, the model learns very little. The limited data does not provide enough variability or information for the model to learn effectively.

At sample sizes of 1000 Points, there is noticeable improvement in the model's performance.

At the largest sample size, achieves good performance within a few epochs. Here, an epoch involves the model seeing 10,000 points, which significantly accelerates learning
and leads to more accurate results due to the greater amount of data and variability provided.
