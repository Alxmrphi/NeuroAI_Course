Question: For adversarial images, how do the RDMs change when comparing representations from the standard model to the adversarially trained model?

Note for adversarial images, the representation similarity of the standard model within each category (the block effect) is notably disrupted in the deeper layers.
Conversely, for the adversarially trained model, despite the introduction of adversarial examples, the representation similarity matrix for preserves its block-like structure across categories.
