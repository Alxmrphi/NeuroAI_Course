Question: How does the RDMs relate to the performances of the standard and the adversarially trained models on clean and adversarial images?

RDMs provide a visual and quantitative way to analyze how a neural network processes and represents different stimuli. By comparing the similarity of responses within the network across various inputs, the RDM can reveal insights into the network's internal representations and, consequently, its ability to generalize.
