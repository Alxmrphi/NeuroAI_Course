Discussion: 1. Does the bound not depend on the dimension $d$ of the original space? Observe the dimension $k$ that preserves Euclidean distance up to a small distortion for both the 2-neuron and 100-neuron datasets.

2. What is the distance between the two identical stimuli after random projection?

1. No. The dimension that preserves euclidean distance up to a small distortion for the 100-neuron dataset is not much larger than the one for the 2-neuron dataset.

2. The distance is always 0.
