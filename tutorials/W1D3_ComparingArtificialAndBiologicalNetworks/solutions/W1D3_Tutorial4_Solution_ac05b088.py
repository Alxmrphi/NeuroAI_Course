Discussion: For isotropic gaussian noise, what is the relationship between euclidean and mahalanobis distance?

For isotropic Gaussian noise, the Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance are equivalent up to a constant factor. When the covariance matrix is an identity matrix, the Euclidean and Mahalanobis distances are exactly equal.
