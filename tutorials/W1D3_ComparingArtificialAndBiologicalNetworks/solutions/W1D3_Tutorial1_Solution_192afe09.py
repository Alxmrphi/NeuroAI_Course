Question: For adversarial images, how do the RDMs change when comparing representations from the standard model to the adversarially trained model?

With adversarial images, the within-category representation similarity (the block effect) is disrupted in the deeper layers of the standard model.
The adversarially trained model preserves its block-like structure across categories when presented with adversarial images, however.
