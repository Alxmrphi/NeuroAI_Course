Discussion: Do you think these particular tasks are similar? Do you expect the model to learn their general nature?

Though being pretty distinct visually, they share joint underlying dynamics - weekly oscillation modeled by sinusoid and general increasing trend with squared term, we expect the model to learn exactly these patterns and to adapt quickly to the particular case.
