Discussion: Why do you think the R-squared value is still higher for this particular
example of concept shift compared to the covariate shift?

In this example, concept shift preserves the annual and weekly trends (we can see that
predictions oscillate the same way as the shifted function). Thus, the R-squared value is relatively high.
