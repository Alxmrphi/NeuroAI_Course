Discussion: How would you qualitatively evaluate the model's performance on autumn data? Does it capture the annual trend? Does it capture the weekly trend?

Model predictions are completely invariant to the weekly seasonality of the data, though they somewhat capture the increasing trend.
Thus, it definitely can't be used to make quality predictions on a daily basis.
