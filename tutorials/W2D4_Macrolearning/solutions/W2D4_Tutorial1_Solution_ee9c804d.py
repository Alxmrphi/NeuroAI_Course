Discussion: How would you qualitatively evaluate the model performance on autumn data? Does it capture the annual trend? Does it capture weekly trend?

Model predictions are completely invariant to the weekly seasonality of the data, though it somewhat captures the increasing trend.
Thus, definitely, it can't be used for making quality predictions on the daily basis.
