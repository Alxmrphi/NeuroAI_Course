Discussion: Is there any difference between the trajectories for the modular and holistic agents? If so, what does it imply?

The holistic agent's trajectory has a higher curvature and length than that of the modular agent, suggesting that the modular agent's trajectory is more optimal. This is because, based on the RL objective with a discount factor smaller than 1, the trajectory should be as efficient (involving fewer steps) as possible.
